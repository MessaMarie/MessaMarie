- 👋 Hi, I’m @MessaMarie
- 👀 I’m interested in ... tabletop RPGs, reading, listening to music, and writing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... how to play tabletop RPGs solo with the Mythic Game Master Emulator book, and interested in learning code like Markdown.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing at the moment. I'm just doing my own thing, and taking it a day at a time.
- 📫 How to reach me ... email (mjaj5929@gmail.com). You can also reach me on Instagram or Facebook (Micah Revenant).
